# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

-  My motivation was to learn as much as possible about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript before starting my bootcamp, so i'll have the neccesary skills and basic knowledge to do well from Day 1.
- I built this project to put my newly developed skills and knowledge on HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript in practice.
-  The main problem it solves its showcasing all the important information I have learned during my prework study guide.
- I learned basics about HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript! I also learned how to navigate through the computer Terminal, how to interact between Github and working locally.

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide is devided in 4 different sections: HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. Each section includes what I consider are important notes about each topic that can help anyone have a better understanding on the topic. If you also open the Devtools console, we can see the JavaScript running, it will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first
